You should use this README to document things you did that you thing are clever and could get you marks, or things you couldn't get working and perhaps why. It is fully expected that a lot of students will not complete this coursework—it is designed to be challenging. The mark scheme is also designed to be fair—marks are awarded for everything you complete, with some given for the quality of the code you write.

All the methods have been implemented succesfully and all the local and Autograder test have passed.
For the case insensitive comparison of two strings I have implemented two methods. One that compares each char, and one that compares the whole strings.
I used the std::find_if function to know if an object has already been created instead of using multiple if statements.
I indented the code and followed the regular coding conventions for variable names.
The code is pretty much straightforward and easy to understand, except for the update command where I had to take into account multiple special cases.
